# Each and every foreman-ansible-module needs these:
foreman_user: admin
foreman_password: TopSecret
foreman_port: 8080
foreman_server: localhost
foreman_server_url: "http://{{ foreman_server }}:{{ foreman_port }}"

# Some modules need a single organization/location, others need a list.
# Note the difference to foreman_locations and foreman_organizations.
# Those are definitions.  This is a mapping.
foreman_default_organization: YourOrganization
foreman_default_location: YourLocation
foreman_default_organizations:
  - YourOrganization
foreman_default_locations:
  - YourLocation

# Adjacent files contain empty defaults and examples.
# You do not want to write those resources manually.
# Click them in the Frontend, then get them via api-call, format as yaml
# and write to a (number of) files in your group_vars.
